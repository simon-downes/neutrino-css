# Neutrino CSS

## What

My own CSS framework largely based on the excellent [Pico CSS](https://github.com/picocss/pico).

## Why

Of all the lightweight CSS frameworks Pico is my favourite, but there's a few
things I didn't like and a few things it didn't have that I wanted.

Also I get to stretch my CSS muscles a little bit...

## How

- Clone the repo
- Make sure you have [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) installed
- Run `build.sh`

## Browser support

Who knows Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ - it works well enough for me... ðŸ¤£
